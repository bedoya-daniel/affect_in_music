# Affect in music
This project is a part of my master's degree internship at IRCAM. It's the code of a psychopy experiment that plays audios and uses a 7 point RatingScale to evaluate them.

To use the code you should download the audio stimuli from https://nuage.ircam.fr/index.php/s/UitetvZ3hXGylSi to the same folder where the main script `affect_in_music.py` is.
